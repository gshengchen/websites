        This first picture shows one of the fruit stands in the Mercat de la Boquer√≠a, the central market that is just off the Rambles.
        It's an incredible place, full of every kind of food you might happen to need. It took me a long time to get up the
        nerve to actually take a picture there. You might say I'm kind of a chicken, but since I lived there, it was just
        sort of strange. Do you take pictures of your supermarket?
