        <h1>Antoni Gaudí</h1>
        <p>
          Many tourists are drawn to Barcelona to see Antoni 
          Gaudí's incredible architecture.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Barcelona <a href="#1">celebrated the 150th anniversary</a> 
            of Gaudí's birth in 2002.
        </p>
        <h2>La Casa Milà</h2>
        <p>
           Gaudí's work was essentially useful. La Casa Milà is an apartment 
           building and real people live there. 
        </p>
        <h2>La Sagrada Família</h2>
        <p>
           The complicatedly named and curiously unfinished Expiatory Temple of
            the Sacred Family is the most visited building in Barcelona.
