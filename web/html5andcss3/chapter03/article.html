      <h1>Barcelona's Architect</h1>
      <p>Antoni Gaudí's incredible buildings bring millions of
        tourists to Barcelona each year.</p>
      <p>Gaudí's non-conformity, already visible in his teenage years,
         coupled with his quiet but firm devotion to the church,
         made a unique foundation for his thoughts and ideas.
         His search for simplicity, based on his careful observations
         of nature, is quite apparent in his work,
         from the <a href="#1">Park Guell </a>and its incredible
         sculptures and mosaics, to the Church of the Sacred Family
         and its organic, bulbous towers.</p>
      <h2>La Sagrada Família</h2>
      <p><img src="../image/towers.jpg">The complicatedly named and curiously
        unfinished masterpiece that is the Expiatory Temple of the
        Sacred Family is the most visited building in Barcelona.
        In it, Gaudí combines his vision of nature and architecture
        with his devotion to his faith. The Sagrada Família attracts
        even the non-religious to its doors in large part due to its
        tragic story and its still unfinished state, of which the
        everpresent scaffolding and cranes are permanent reminders.</p>
      <h2>Park Guell</h2>
      <p><img src="../image/dragon.jpg">
        The Park Guell always reminds me of Howard Roark in Ayn
        Rand's <a href="#1"><cite>The Fountainhead</cite></a>. Gaudí's project
        in the Park Guell was to build a residential community whose
        residents would love where they lived. It was never finished.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps that is for the best, since now we all get to enjoy
        it. The Park Guell is set on a hill overlooking practically
        all of Barcelona. Its beautiful and even comfortable
        serpentine bench is filled with foreigners and locals alike
        every day of the week. Its mosaic lizards have become
        synonymous with the city itself.
