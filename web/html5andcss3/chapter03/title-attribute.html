                <p>Antoni Gaudí's incredible buildings bring millions of tourists to Barcelona each year.</p>
                <p>
                    Gaudí's non-conformity, already visible in his teenage years, coupled with his quiet but firm devotion to the church, made
                    a unique foundation for his thoughts and ideas. His search for simplicity, based on his careful observations
                    of nature, is quite apparent in his work, from the
                    <a href="#park">Park Guell</a> and its incredible sculptures and mosaics, to the Church of the
                    <a href="#las">Sacred Family</a> and its organic, bulbous towers.
                </p>
                <h2 id="#las">La Sagrada Família</h2>
                <p>
                    <img src="../image/towers.jpg" alt="">The complicatedly named and curiously unfinished masterpiece that is the Expiatory Temple of the Sacred
                    Family is the most visited building in Barcelona. In it, Gaudí combines his vision of nature and architecture
                    with his devotion to his faith. The Sagrada Família attracts even the non-religious to its doors in large
                    part due to its tragic story and its still unfinished state, of which the everpresent scaffolding and
                    cranes are permanent reminders.</p>
                <h2 id="park">Park Guell</h2>
                <p>
                    <img src="../image/dragon.jpg" alt="okk"> The Park Guell always reminds me of Howard Roark in Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead. Gaudí's project in
                    the Park Guell was to build a residential community whose residents would love where they lived. It was
                    never finished. Perhaps that is for the best, since now we all get to enjoy it. The Park Guell is set
                    on a hill overlooking practically all of Barcelona. Its beautiful and even comfortable serpentine bench
                    is filled with foreigners and locals alike every day of the week. Its mosaic lizards have become synonymous
                    with the city itself.
