    <p>Here's a generic <code>p</code> element. It will be red.</p>
    <p class="example">
        Here's a <code>p</code> element with a <code>class</code> of <code>example</code>. 
        There are two rules 
        that could apply, but since the <code>.example </code>
        selector is more specific, this paragraph will be blue.
    </p>
    <p class="example example-2">
        Hereâ€™s a <code>p</code> element with two classes: 
        <code>example</code> and <code>example-2</code>. 
        There are four rules that could apply to this paragraph. 
        The first two are overruled by the more specific last two. However, 
        because the last two have the same selector, 
        the order breaks the tie between them: the one that 
        appears later wins, and thus this paragraph 
        will be green instead of magenta.
