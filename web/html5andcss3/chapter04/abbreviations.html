        The <abbr title="Nation al Football league">NFL</abbr>
         promised a <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">
         laser</abbr> show at <time datetime="21:00">9 p.m</time>.
         after every night game.

         (Major League Baseball) 
        did. They gave out free 
        <abbr title="self-contained underwater breathing apparatus">
        scuba</abbr> gear during rain delays.
